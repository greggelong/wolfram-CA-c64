# wolfram-CA-c64
a c64 implementation of Wolfram one dimentional cellular automata
Coding dreams are a hazard of creative coding. Lately, in sleep I have the feeling I am printing blocks and spaces across the the canvas of my dreams. As an attempt at a cure through purge, I have implemented the Wolfram one dimensional cellular automata in c64 BASIC.  BASIC is sort of bedrock for me.  It is where i started coding and all of it for creative purposes. I have never made anything useful.
Here each generation is a line of screen memory.  I can peek the value at the previous line and poke a new value according to wolfram rules. this is done with nested for loops and gosub statements. So here to I avoid using an array to hold values.  Here you can see rule 30 and rule 18 #wolfram #creativecoding #c64 #commodore #commodore64
